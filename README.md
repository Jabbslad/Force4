Force4
======

### Overview

Force 4 is a Simple isometric Java game which is being developed while I learn Java.

### Build

I have developed this in Eclipse IDE on OSX 10.8 using Java 1.7

The code should deb generic for any other IDE and all that will be required is to ensure that the **/res** folder is included in the build path so that assets can be located. 

### Reference
